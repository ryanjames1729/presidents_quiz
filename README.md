# presidents_quiz
This is a python script that will take a Google Form quiz and based on the feedback adjust its answers for the next time it takes the quiz. By the end, the program can receive a perfect score on the quiz.

The quiz that the script takes is a 5 question quiz on US Presidents. Since the script picks answers at random it can take anywhere from a minute to 3 minutes for the program to determine the correct answers.
The link for the google form quiz is: https://goo.gl/forms/bHx4lCpiDDrVwWRv2

This was done to demonstrate to my students how a program can "learn" from its mistakes and refine its decision making. I would love any thoughts on how this can be improved as I am not a professional programmer.

I want my free shirt, Mr. James.
